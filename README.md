# covid-visualisations

A companion repository for my "Building an animated COVID-19 tracker using Vue.js" article.

To set it up, run `npm install` and then `npm run get-data`.

Then, the normal vue-cli instructions apply:

### Compiles and hot-reloads for development
```
npm run serve
```

### Compiles and minifies for production
```
npm run build
```

### Lints and fixes files
```
npm run lint
```

### Customize configuration
See [Configuration Reference](https://cli.vuejs.org/config/).
